# 📝 Handwritten Character Recognition

This project is developed as part of my **CodeAlpha Internship**.  
It focuses on building a **Machine Learning model** that can recognize handwritten digits/characters using **Deep Learning techniques**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Handwritten Character Recognition is a classic problem in the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning.  
The goal of this project is to train a neural network model that can correctly classify handwritten characters from images.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Recognizes handwritten **digits (0–9)** from the **MNIST dataset**  
- Built using **TensorFlow & Keras**  
- Achieves high accuracy on test data  
- Visualizes model training and predictions  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib
